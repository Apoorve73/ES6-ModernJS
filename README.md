# ES6-ModernJS
Code snippets explaining ES6 in detail! Most of the possible scenario while writing example code, are considered.

### ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. 
### It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. 
### JavaScript has remained the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript since the very first publishment in 1997.

## The 6th edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) 
Later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including class declarations, 
```
(class Foo { ... })
```
### ES6 modules like 
```
import * as moduleName from "..."; 
export const Foo
```
### but defines them **semantically** in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. 

Other new features include *iterators and for...of loops*, *Python-style generators*, *arrow function expression*
```
(() => {...})
```
```let``` keyword for local declarations, ```const``` keyword for constant local declarations, 
*binary data, typed arrays, new collections* (maps, sets and WeakMap), *promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, proxies* (metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers) and *template literals for strings*. The complete list is **extensive**.

### **As the first "ECMAScript Harmony" specification, it is also known as "ES6 Harmony."**
